## Abridged Abstract

Adult-trained CT denoising models were shown to perform poorly in pediatric CT due to Field-of-view (FOV) differences between adult and pediatric CT protocols. This project use noise patches from pediatric protocol phantom scans to augment training with adult datasets. This technique can improve performance in smaller-pediatric patients not represented in the training dataset.

![Figure 1a](notebooks/figures/fig1a_traditional.png)
*Figure 1a Traditional model training where training input patches are input to a model to make a prediction that is compared against the training target using the loss function to update the model.*

![Figure 1b](notebooks/figures/fig1b_augmented.png)
*Figure 1b In noise texture augmented training noise patches are added to the low noise training target to make new augmented inputs. While training, a proportion λ of the training data mini batch is from the augmented inputs while the remaining 1 − λ is from the original low dose training inputs.*

![Figure 5](notebooks/figures/fig5_noise_reduction.png)
*Figure 5 Denoising efficiency as a function of phantom size with body fitting reconstructed field of view (FOV). a) Noise reduction performance defined as reduction of pixel intensity standard deviation (std) relative to filtered backprojection (fbp): noise std reduction [%] = [fbp std - denoised std]/fbp std ×100%. Noise in uniform phantoms is measured in central circular regions of interest (ROIs) 40% the phantom diameter. In anthropomorphic phantoms, the ROI size was set at 30% phantom effective diameter and only applied to slices where there was enough liver to fit the ROI, see Figure 4 for examples. b) Noise reduction performance defined as reduction in root mean squared error (rmse) with the ground truth simulated phantom: rmse reduction [%] = [fbp rmse – denoised rmse]/fbp rmse ×100%.*

*Denoising performance measured as pixel intensity standard deviation (std) measured in liver regions of interest (ROIs) from anthropomorphic phantoms. The ROI size was set at 30% phantom effective diameter and only applied to slices where there was enough liver to fit the ROI, see Figure 4 for examples. Pediatric subgroups are based on the waist diameters defined in Table 2.*

Average MTF cutoffs values are shown for each pediatric subgroup based on phantom diameter (Table 1) with error bars representing the 95% bootstrap confidence interval.*

![Figure 8](notebooks/figures/fig8_task_performance.png)
*Figure 8 Low contrast detectability area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) as a function of phantom diameter from quarter dose test images. Detectability is assessed using two model observers: a Laguerre-Gauss Channelized Hotelling observer (LG-CHO) and a non-prewhitening (NPW) observer. The 3 HU contrast lesion has a diameter of 10% the phantom diameter and the 14 HU diameter is 5% the phantom diameter.*

## Reproducing all figures

### Requirements

If running on your local machine 2 datasets are required:

1. [pediatricIQphantoms dataset](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10064035) which contains pediatric-sized versions of uniform water, CCT189 MITA-LCD, and CTP404 phantoms based off of of the [Catphan 600 phantom](https://www.phantomlab.com/catphan-600), this dataset is used for evaluating the deep learning denoising model and augmentation method
2. Mayo Clinic Low Dose Grand Challenge Dataset: [https://doi.org/10.7937/9npb-2637](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/ldct-and-projection-data/), required for training the deep learning denoising models in [01_train_denoiser_with_augmentation.ipynb](notebooks/01_train_denoiser_with_augmentation.ipynb)
3. `git clone https://github.com/DIDSR/LCD_CT.git`, used for low contrast detectability assessments in [04_task_performance.ipynb](notebooks/04_task_performance.ipynb)

Run the following either all at once or line by line to run the contents of each notebook non-interactively to update/reproduce the figures in [notebooks/results](notebooks/results)

```bash
  jupyter nbconvert notebooks/00_characterizing_noise_augmentation.ipynb --execute --to notebook --inplace
